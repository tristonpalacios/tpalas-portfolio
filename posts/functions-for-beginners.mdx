  As my inaugural post here on my <strong>illustrious</strong> blog, let me start off with a statement of admittance. I am not a writer (so get ready for some rough around edges type writing), and I in no way, shape, or form, believe that I should be considered an authority on any topics you find here. In reality, I am a student, not in the traditional sense, well maybe in the traditional sense, but mostly in the sense that everything you read here is an amalgamation of thoughts on things I am trying to cement or clarify in my own head.
</div>

My hope for me is that through writing this blog, I will gain two things.

1.A place where I can further digest my own ideas to become a more well-informed individual.

2.A place where the general public (If any ever read this) can have well-informed debates with me to better temper both of our minds. 

My hope for you through reading this blog is that you will gain a few things.

1.A place for you to feel smarter than the author (because surely you will be).

2.A place for you to be entertained through my illustrations and unfiltered writing.

3.A place where even you may learn something new or be refreshed on something you learned long ago in a land far far away. 

## a portal into the future.

I believe I have a lot to gain through writing and illustrating whatever it is that I am currently manically tossing around my brain, however, as I have no prior experience writing outside of binging the occasional college paper the night before it is due.. I cannot say what the topics of this blog will likely include. I am currently obsessing over Coral (yes the sea creatures), Algorithms (Yes the thing that makes Software Engineers feel insecure), and the Tragedy of the Commons (Yes, the thing that economists bring up in every single discussion so that they can let people know how based they are).

So what is next for this blog? Well, maybe all of the above or maybe none of it. I don't know! Get off my back about it!

Anyhow, hopefully, Iâ€™ll see you soon and until then here is a drawing of a cat.
