Since launching this blog I have been getting a lot of feedback which has really been motivating me to keep on writing! So if you‚Äôre one of the ones who have reached out, thank you so much.

Some of the feedback I have received has been questions about my experience going through a coding Bootcamp and if I would recommend it. So I figured I would condense some of those questions and answer them here in case anyone is ever interested. So, without further ado here is a Bootcamp Grad FAQ. 

*IF there are any questions I don't answer please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn and I would love to help!

**This one might be a VERY long ride. Hopefully, the way I have it laid out will be helpful for you!

### Question One: Was it worth it? üî¶
This question is by far the most common I get but is also the hardest to answer. For me, going to a coding Bootcamp was a great option and I feel no regrets in doing so. However, I do not think that a coding Bootcamp is for everyone and it is in no way shape, or form a way to get you paid 6 figures overnight. 

The reality is that a coding Bootcamp is the absolute best option you could do to get the most information in the shortest amount of time, but it is not going to get you even close to being a sought-after commodity in the job field. Instead, the best-case scenario is that by the end of the Bootcamp you will be ready to compete with college grads for a Junior Dev job/Apprenticeships/internships. Now in my opinion this isn't a knock on the Bootcamp route, but rather just a reality of the software industry in general. 

The software industry is unbelievably complex and large and the only way to really excel is to spend thousands of hours getting better at working on Software. So no matter what route you take, EXPERIENCE is what puts commas on your salary, NOT your schooling. IF you ask me, it is unrealistic to expect General Assembly to convert you to a 6 figure engineer in three months but it is the reality that you will leave there on an expedited path up the mountain with some tools that will help you get to the top. 

For me, as someone who had already been to college and just wasn't sure where to get started in trying to learn Software Engineering, General Assembly got me moving for a fraction of what a University costs and in a fraction of the time. So yes, for ME it was worth it.


### Question Two: Did you know any coding going in? üíæ
I knew a minuscule amount from College(Mostly scraps from a single CS class) and a tad bit from general interest in the field and the resulting late-night Youtube rabbit holes it led me down. But I think IF you are interested in the field you could do a coding Bootcamp with ZERO prior experience and be just fine.

I think a lot of people imagine software engineering to be some zodiac-code level enigma that you have to be a genius to decrypt but that is not true. If you really want to learn; you will and can.

### Question Three: Was it as hard as people say? üí™
Yes and no. It was pretty much my entire life for 3 months, but I never felt like I wasn't going to make it through. The tools GA offers and the wonderful teachers I had made me feel like if I just put the work in, I would be more than fine. However, I do think that for some people that are maybe not joining up for the right reasons, it may be impossible. The sheer amount of work you do in the 12 weeks is incredible and overwhelming and without a serious passion it will wear you out FAST.

I‚Äôm not kidding you that I and many of my classmates were literally DREAMING about software at night because our brains were so immersed in it from the time we woke up to the time we went to sleep; it seriously becomes your entire life. 

Also, on just a side note about the difficulty of the work itself; it's not bad; it‚Äôs challenging. Be prepared to be underwater and to be constantly leaning on your classmates and instructors because that's just the nature of the beast. You‚Äôre going to be learning new things nonstop and I can guarantee you that not a single person has gone through a Bootcamp without feeling overwhelmed at some point. But on the light side, you‚Äôre not the guinea pig (at least not at GA) and the way you‚Äôre being taught has been proven thousands of times before you to be effective. 

### Question Four: What don‚Äôt they tell you when joining a coding Bootcamp? (‚ÄúThe Negative Secrets‚Äù) ü§´
Ahhh, I love this question because it sounds so nefarious like I‚Äôm giving you the dirt on Bootcamps.. But seriously though there are a few things I wish I had been told before joining up that I would like to pass along.. 

##### First and foremost Secret: You have to want it. 

Bootcamps are a business so, of course, they‚Äôre going to pack as many people in as they can without pointing out the elephant in the room. YOU are entering one of the most competitive industries on the planet and unless you are going to give it 100% of your effort, you will not find success.  The people that get jobs after a Bootcamp are the ones who spend all of their time (yes even their free time) working on getting better. If you think you‚Äôre going to do the bare minimum and going to grace into a job because you have a ‚ÄúCertificate of Completion‚Äù you are tremendously misinformed. Finding a job in the software industry is absolutely no easy task and you will not just grace into a job because you ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù from either a Bootcamp or School. Seriously every job posting for a Junior Dev role I see has at least a few hundred applicants within an hour of being posted if the job is decent. You cannot afford to be average in this industry, you have to WANT it and be willing to work at it harder than the other candidates.

##### Second Secret: The hardest part is what happens after you finish the Bootcamp.

Following up on my last point, finding a job in the software industry is hard as hell and it will not be a quick process. (I‚Äôve decided to make this its own question, see below for more.) 

##### Third Secret: The world of Software Engineering is immense and you should explore the diversity before picking a Bootcamp.

I think for a lot of people outside of the industry, ‚ÄúSoftware‚Äù, means one thing but the reality could not be further from the truth. The world of software is seriously broken into thousands of different subsections and languages and a single Bootcamp will teach you less than 1% of them. I would highly recommend thinking about what you want to do, finding a job posting for that job, looking at the requirements for the job, and then finding schooling accordingly. 

Just as a quick example for more context.. I wanted to use my art skills to create mobile apps/games and I thought Javascript would be a good starting point, but as I have come to find out, Javascript is not really the best language to learn for app development. WHOOPS! Luckily I did end up falling in love with Web Dev so I‚Äôm not too broken up about it but I really should have done more research going in.

### Question Five: What don‚Äôt they tell you when joining a coding Bootcamp? (‚ÄúThe Positive Secret‚Äù) ü•≥

In my opinion and to my great surprise; the best thing I learned from a coding bootcamp was not the coding. It honestly may be shocking but in reality, I would say the soft skills you learn from such a rigorous program are where you really get your value. Just a few of the soft skills I‚Äôm talking about are as follows.

1. You learn how to LEARN. I mean this as literally as I can. Even as someone who graduated college, I have never studied and taught myself so many new things in such a short amount of time. Before GA, if you would have told me to go learn a new language or instrument or whatever I wouldn‚Äôt have known where to start. But now, when I see something I don't understand I feel seriously capable of figuring it out. Before GA, It seriously never occurred to me that ‚ÄúLearning‚Äù is a muscle in itself but it is and it‚Äôs important to exercise. 

2. Socializing/Scrum/Collaboration: Seriously a Bootcamp is a collaboration environment like you wouldn't believe. Throughout 3 months everyone in your Bootcamp is going to be working together so closely that you will seriously become family. Not only that but you will get used to talking things out that you don't understand and you'll get very used to planning out projects that seem too big to even wrap your head around. IF you never write code again after graduating, your newfound or refined collaboration skills are seriously valuable enough for you not to feel any regret for attending. 


### Question Six: What does the workload look like? üìà
It varies but the short answer is 40 hours of lecture(in-class time) a week and 10-20+ hours of homework or projects. Typically each month was broken down into one big topic, with each day being a fraction of the big picture, which then would conclude with a big project where we would put it all together. Like I said above, the workload is doable but it is a ton of work regardless. 

### Question Seven: College Vs. Bootcamp? üéì vs. ü•æ
This is tough to answer because I didn't get a CS degree from college (I got a BS in Planning) but given that I do get asked this I will tell you what I‚Äôve experienced(Feel free to @ me if you think I‚Äôm wrong I would love to hear your opinion). The main difference is that Bootcamps teach you the tools and application of programming whereas CS college grads seem to be much more attuned to the theory and abstractness of coding. So like a rough example would be that a Bootcamp grad can likely make a better website, but a CS grad can likely better understand algorithms or data structures. 

Funny enough though, where some may think being able to actually spin up sites would give them the edge on getting their first dev job, most tech interviews are actually heavily favored towards CS majors because they tend to be an algorithm or data structure questions. However, I actually sat in on a recruiting seminar where the recruiters did mention this and it seems like the ‚Äútake-home project‚Äù assessments are growing in popularity to try to balance the ‚ÄúFavoritism‚Äù towards traditionally educated individuals.

In my mind, if you‚Äôre a little older or don't really have the ability to take 4 years of college then going to a Bootcamp is a very good option. But if you‚Äôre just graduating high school and were going to go to college anyway, I wouldn‚Äôt skip college for a Bootcamp. 
*Also for full transparency I am currently enrolled in Community College because I felt like grabbing a few certificates to better round out my Bootcamp background so I would say a mix of options is good too. 

### Question Eight: Why GA vs Other Bootcamps? ‚öôÔ∏è
The only Bootcamp I‚Äôve gone to is GA so it‚Äôs hard to say if I made the right choice, but for me, I chose GA because of the people I spoke to when applying and because I liked the way they let you guide what your projects were.

	I did apply to and get accepted into a few different boot camps but for whatever reason, they all seemed much more like a business than a school compared to GA and it tended to rub me the wrong way. With GA they talked to me a lot about what the class would look like, took a lot of care to see if it was really the right option for me, and in the end, those personal touches won me over.  

### Question Nine: What didn‚Äôt you learn that you wished you did? üìö

This one is tough because I feel like if I went into the ‚Äúexactly right‚Äù job, I could have gotten by with no extra knowledge than what GA taught me. But as I mentioned before the job search is competitive and extremely diverse, so the things I find myself ‚Äúwishing‚Äù GA had taught me tend to fluctuate based on what job I am currently looking at. 

In reality though, the only place GA may have truly fallen a little short is in the Datastructures and Algorithms dept. Not because we didn‚Äôt learn them in my Bootcamp but because our mettle in them didnt get tested thoroughly enough to feel confident in utilizing them on the fly. For example: spending a day or two on merge sort is a far cry from the time it takes to know it enough to utilize it to solve a tech interview problem on the spot. The only upside is that what they didn't drill in enough, they did give me the tooleset to feel comfortable figuring it out on my own.

 Also, if you do follow my recommendation and search for your ideal job before picking a Bootcamp you‚Äôll likely have far fewer blindspots when exiting the program. 


### Question Ten: Do you think you could self-teach yourself what a Bootcamp did? üí¢
Absolutely not. 

I get this question all the time and have been argued with about it more times than I can count. In reality, sure you could feasibly utilize Youtube and other free tools to self-teach yourself anything, but I think is wildly impractical to expect good results from that. As I mentioned before the world of Software is COMPETITIVE and without guidance and constant help laying a good foundation, you‚Äôre never going to be able to compete. Of course, there are people that have self-taught and found success but it takes serious mental gymnastics to expect that to be the optimal path. It‚Äôs survivorship bias 101: For every self-taught Software Engineer you see who found success in the field, you‚Äôre not seeing the innumerable amount who failed to do so. 

### Question Eleven: Any General Advice for those considering doing a Bootcamp? ü´Ç

1. Ask yourself why you‚Äôre joining a Bootcamp and make sure it‚Äôs for the right reasons before spending all the $. I know I keep harping on this but you have to want to learn in this field and if you‚Äôre thinking you can just do ‚ÄúSoftware Engineering‚Äù to make more money you‚Äôre not going to get far.

2. Do the research on what you‚Äôre getting into and if it will get you to where you want to go. IF you‚Äôre not willing to do the research use that as a sign to not join a Bootcamp because I promise you that‚Äôs a sign you don't want it enough. 

3. Find your humility. Learning software engineering and computer science in general is insanely tough and it‚Äôs going to test your ability to admit you need help or that you just don't know something enough yet. Also, you‚Äôre going to get rejected over and over again when looking for your first job, it doesn't mean you made a mistake or that you cant do it, it just means you gotta keep working at it so don't take it to heart.

4. If you want to do it but you‚Äôre scared, believe in yourself. No investment is more worth it than the one you make in yourself. 

### Final thoughts: üëãüèΩ

Hopefully, this QA has helped you find some of the answers you were looking for. This is not a paid promotion or anything like that, I genuinely just want to pass along whatever I can so that it may help somebody. Again, If there is anything I didn't answer that you really need to know please do feel free to reach out. Also, any other Grads who feel they have a common question or have anything to add, I‚Äôd love to hear from you and add it to what I have. 

Thank you so much for your time!
